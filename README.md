# Dog_Breed_Recognition
 Used Keras to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human.  Also, improved results significantly by using pre-trained networks.
